# data-structures-project
A project from my data structures class.
In this assignment we had to create a tree and traverse the tree. This was my first experience using nodes.
Using post, pre, and level order traversal we can sort the data.
Each folder can by imported into the Eclipse IDE

Also saved the tree into a folder to view.
